Pre-update discord styles for BetterDiscord.

update: everything is fixed now, despite being messy. compact mode support is GONE due to the new discord UI changes.

**NOTE:** If you get blurry text while using this theme, please disable **Settings -> Appearance -> Hardware Acceleration.** (shoutout to prof lol)

Less important note: by default, this theme hides inline message timestamps, resembling the old version. You can comment out the css that does this, it is found on the first few lines. You may also uncomment the 'opacity' property to always show timestamps without hovering.

This theme is pretty minimal and does not change too much. It only aims to look like discord before the recent UI update, so don't expect a full overhaul. You may be able to use other themes over it, though I have not tested this.
I doubt the css is clean as I never really learned how to use it, but it has commented sections so you can change/delete what you don't like.

This theme supports both light and dark mode as well as both cozy and compact mode. However, it will work better on cozy.

'Installation': Download the [discold.theme.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PATXS/Discold/master/discold.theme.css) file and put it in the betterdiscord themes folder.
OR just open the css file, copy everything, and paste it into Custom CSS. This theme is (mostly) not compatible with discord web.

Screenshots are included below. If you find any issues, let me know or submit a pull request. Will try to keep it up-to-date with new versions.
